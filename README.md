# Chatroom
Multithreaded Chat Server in C: This project implements a multithreaded chat room in C. The server listens on port 2000, accepts client connections, and handles communication between clients. Each connected client can send messages to the server, which are then broadcasted to all other connected clients. The server uses POSIX threads for handling multiple clients concurrently.
